# PROMPTS.md

Below are the coding‑assistant prompts I used while building this submission.

1) “Create a mobile‑first React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind starter with two pages: a courts list (search/filter, load more) and a court detail (reviews, localStorage). Include a mock generator for >50 courts.”

2) “Implement accessible rating stars with text fallback and show a precise numeric average.”

3) “Add a simple ReviewForm component that writes to localStorage and refreshes the view.”

The remainder of the code and UI decisions were implemented manually.
